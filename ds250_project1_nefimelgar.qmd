## Elevator pitch

_Names as ways to identify individuals have been used through world's history. This project involves data exploration, visualization, and interpretation to gain insights into the trends and patterns related to different names over time. Is Brittany a name for old or young ladies? Has Luke Skywalker from Star Wars influeced the names of a generation? Let's dive in to the results._

```{python}
#| label: project data
#| code-summary: Read and format project data
# Include and execute your code here
names_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byuidatascience/data4names/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv"
names = pd.read_csv(names_url)
```

__Highlight the Questions and Tasks__

## QUESTION 1

__How does your name at your birth year compare to its use historically?__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
matthew_data = names.query('name == "Matthew"')

# important year, starting year for the plot and born year
STARTING_YEAR = 1910
BORN_YEAR = 1993

# convert 'year' column to datetime data type
matthew_data["year"] = pd.to_datetime(matthew_data["year"], format="%Y")

# filter the data, only include data points from the starting year and higher
filtered_data = matthew_data[matthew_data["year"] >= str(STARTING_YEAR)]

# select year was born
birth_year_filter = filtered_data[filtered_data["year"] == str(BORN_YEAR)]

# create chart of name through the years
through_years_chart = (
    alt.Chart(filtered_data).encode(x=alt.X("year:T"), y=alt.Y("Total")).mark_line()
)

# create a chart for the birth year 1993
year_point = (
    alt.Chart(birth_year_filter)
    .mark_circle()
    .encode(x=alt.X("year:T"), y=alt.Y("Total"), color=alt.value("red"))
    .properties(title="Matthew name through the years")
)

matthew_year_chart = through_years_chart + year_point

matthew_year_chart.interactive()

```

## APPENDIX A (All Python Code)

```python
#paste other your code from your python file (.py) here
#the code snippets above should be just enough code to display the chart or table needed for the question or task
#the appendix should have all the code, and it should be well `commented`
```
